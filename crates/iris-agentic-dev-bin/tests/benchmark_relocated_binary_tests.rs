//! Regression: `benchmark --skill ...` used to bake in the BUILD machine's
//! `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` to locate the jira_bugs task suite on disk. That
//! path only exists on whichever machine happened to compile the binary — e.g. a
//! GitHub Actions cross-compile runner's `/home/runner/work/...` — so it broke for
//! every user who downloaded a released binary, on every platform, regardless of
//! whether they had the source tree checked out or not.
//!
//! Root cause of the miss: every prior benchmark test ran via `cargo test`/`cargo
//! run` from inside the checked-out repo, where `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` is always
//! valid by construction. No test ever executed the binary from anywhere else.
//!
//! These tests copy the already-built binary into a fresh temp directory with NO
//! relationship to the source tree (a real workspace member deleted, `cd`'d away
//! from) and run it from there — structurally reproducing "user downloads a release
//! asset to some random folder." If a future change reintroduces a build-time
//! absolute path for any embedded/bundled resource, this is what will catch it.
